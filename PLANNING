* ActivationHandle<Tile> ... just store a pointer to this in the hardware
  * a location, handles providing pipes to neighbors
  * needs to handle edge case on MPI proc

* things that need to be serialized at every update CellFrame
  * channel ID (visible to cell; visible to tiles)
  * resource (visible to cell)
  * signal state (hidden from cells)
  * outgoing messages (visible to cells)
    * neighbors query this for their incoming messages at the beginning of an update

* this is my hardware... (CellHardware)... do inheritance from ???
  * pointer to its ActivationHandle<tile>
  * facings
  * e.g., program and in-flight program
  * only genotype will need to be serialized at reproduction

InstructionLib ???
