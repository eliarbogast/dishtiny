          Each viewer depicts alternate information about the state of the same toroidal grid, where each tile can support a single cell-like organism.
          Each cell-like organism is controlled by a SignalGP program.
          <br />
          <br />
          Cell-like organisms can cooperate to collect resource, which allows them to reproduce into adjacent tiles.
          Two distinct levels of cooperation, which are hierarchically nested, exist.
          That is, several low-level groups can unite into a single high-level cooperating group.
          Group membership is hereditarily defined and fixed at birth, with hierarchal nesting strictly enforced;
          a daughter cell can take membership within both its parent's high- and low-level groups, just its parent's high-level group (starting a new low-level group), or neither its parent's high- or low-level group (starting new high- and low-level gorups).
          Black grid tiles are empty.
          In the "Channel Viewer", low-level groups are coded by color saturation (divided by white lines) and high-level groups are coded by color hue (divided by black lines).
          <br />
          <br />
          The "Stockpile Viewer" depicts the resource that each cell-like organism has accumulated.
          Black grid tiles are dead cells.
          Red indicates a resource defecit (which, if it becomes too extreme, will result in that cell's death).
          White indicates zero resource.
          Blue indicates positive resource, but below the threshold required for reproduction.
          Green indicates an amount of resource equal to the cost of a single reproduction.
          Yellow indicates an amount of resource greater than the cost of a single reproduction.
          <br />
          <br />
          The "Contribution Viewer" depicts the amount of resource has received from neighbors during the previous update.
          Black grid tiles are dead cells.
          White indicates zero resource was received.
          Blue indicates a small amount of resource was received, green indicates a medium amount of resource was received, and yellow indicates a large amount of resource was received.
          <br />
          <br />
          The "Wave Viewer" depicts the resource-collection task that cell groups cooperate to perform.
          Two grid views are depicted: one for each distinct level of cooperation.
          Green and red colorings both indicate an active state.
          Activation propigates outward in cooperating groups from an environmentally-triggered seed.
          Activation within a certain radius of the seed is beneficial, while ativation beyond that radius is harfmul.
          Cells in the green state gain resource.
          Cells in the red state lose resource.
          White cells are in the ready state, meaning they can be activated by adjacent cooperating cells.
          Blue indicates a quiescent state, meaning they cannot be activated by adjacent cooperating cells.
          Black cells are empty.
          <br />
          <br />
          The "Wave Viewer" depicts the distribution of genetically-identical cells.
          White cells are occupied and black cells are empty.
          Red divisions indicate neighboring cells with non-identical genotypes.
          <br />
          <br />
          To run the simulation, press "Start."
          This will render each step of the simulation on the viewers, which is computationally intensive.
          To make the simulation run more quickly, you may temporarily disable rendering using the "Toggle Render" button.
          When you're ready to re-activate rendering to check on the state of the simulation, hit the "Toggle Render" button again.
          For the viewers to render, the simulation will need to run for at least a single step (e.g., via "Start" or "Step").
